# Algorithms
This repository contains some fundamental algorithms learned in Algorithm class in Ariel University.

## Algorithms

LIS - O(nlogn)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20longest,not%20necessarily%20contiguous%2C%20or%20unique.

LCS - O(n*m)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem#:~:text=The%20longest%20common%20subsequence%20(LCS,(often%20just%20two%20sequences).


Airplane problem - O(n*m)

Edit levinsteins distance - O(n*m)
